//step one create a new feature branch to work from

//step two add this JavaScript file to index.html

//step three add the following functionality:
// when a name is clicked on a card with the rest of their info is displayed in div .two
const divOne = document.querySelector(".one");


// use only one event listener on div .one (event object and bubbling hint hint)
// if a second name is clicked the first card disapears and is replaced by a new card 
// only one card can be displayed at a time.
// hint .remove()
// use a template created with a template literal for your new card.
// hint including a div in your template will help with removing it.

//step four add just enough styling to make your app look a little nicer, without removing any of the existing styling.
